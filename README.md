# Welcome

In theory, I am writing about my programming experiences on a [blog](https://giannitedesco.github.io). In practice, updates are few and far between. But I do have some future articles bubbling away in the background.

## Active Projects
- âš¡ I'm currently actively working, in my spare time, on
     [xpdt](https://github.com/giannitedesco/xpdt) and
     [resynth](https://github.com/giannitedesco/resynth).
- ðŸ‘· I consider [minotaur](https://github.com/giannitedesco/minotaur) to be actively maintained
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently having a great time learning Rust

## Inactive Projects
These projects are, in general, over 10 years old and have not been worked on actively by anyone in at least that long: 
- [ScaraOS](https://github.com/giannitedesco/scaraOS) is a toy 32bit operating system kernel
- [ccid-utils](https://github.com/giannitedesco/ccid-utils) is a chip-card and emv driver and middleware
- [firestorm](https://github.com/giannitedesco/firestorm) was a network intrusion detection system whose focus was on performance and protocol decodes. I don't work on this any more because I'm working in this area in my professional life instead.
